App Router complete patch (fixes missing Navbar/Footer module errors)

IMPORTANT:
- Copy the folders from this zip into the ROOT of your repo.
- Do NOT keep a parent folder like `app-router-folder/` in your repo.
  You should end up with: `app/`, `components/`, `styles/`, `public/` at the repo root.

What this includes:
- app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx, app/programs/page.tsx
- components/site/Navbar.tsx, components/site/Footer.tsx
- styles/globals.css
